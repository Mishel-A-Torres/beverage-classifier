Project name: beverage-classifier



Description:

Beverage-classifier Python project Instead of training a traditional CNN, this classifier uses a zero-shot
learning approach.
CLIP embeds both images and text into the same vector space.

The model computes cosine similarity between:
The embedding of the input image
The embeddings of predefined drink labels
The label with the highest similarity score is selected as the prediction.


Instructions: 

1-Install the required Python packages with the following commands:
"pip install torch transformers pillow"

Or use the requirements file:
"pip install -r requirements.txt"

2-Running the Classifier
*Place your images inside: images_to_test
*Run the inference script: python predict.py

3-View the Results
*The predicted labels will be printed in the terminal.


Model explanation: 

1*CLIP (Contrastive Language Image Pre-training)
-Image encoder: Vision Transformer (ViT-B/32)
-Text encoder: Transformer-based language model
-Training objective: contrastive learning between images and text

2*Inference Process:
-Image Loading
-The image is read using PIL and converted to RGB.
-Preprocessing:
The CLIPProcessor normalizes and resizes the image and tokenizes the text labels then encodingm (it produces:
logits_per_image and logits_per_text).

3*Similarity Computation:
Logits are passed through a softmax to obtain probabilities across all labels.

4*Prediction Output:
Highest probability = predicted beverage category.


Dependencies: 
*Transformers: to load the CLIP model from Hugging Face
*Torch (PyTorch): for tensor operations and model inference
*Pillow (PIL): for opening and reading images
